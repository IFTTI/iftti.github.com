						<p>Many people have asked about the Balloons playground we demonstrated when introducing Swift at WWDC. Balloons shows that writing code can be interactive and fun, while presenting several great features of playgrounds. Now you can learn how the special effects were done with this tutorial version of ‘Balloons.playground’, which includes documentation and suggestions for experimentation.</p>
<p>This playground uses new features of SpriteKit and requires the latest beta versions of Xcode 6 and <span class="nowrap">OS X Yosemite</span>.</p>
