						<p>In Swift, a pattern is a way to describe and match a set of values based on certain rules, such as: </p>
<ul class="tight">
<li>All tuples whose first value is 0</li>
<li>All numbers in the range 1...5</li>
<li>All class instances of a certain type</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning playground linked below includes embedded documentation and experiments for you to perform. Download it for an interactive experience that will give you a jump start into using patterns in your own apps.</p>
<p>This playground requires the latest beta version of Xcode 6 on OS X Mavericks or OS X Yosemite beta.</p>
