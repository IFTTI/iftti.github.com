						<p>So far the Swift blog has focused on advanced programming topics, including the design principles of the Swift language. We thought it would be helpful to provide content for programmers who are new to Swift and just trying Xcode for the first time. To make it more approachable for everyone, we put together a very short video that demonstrates how to build an iOS app in Swift from scratch, in less than ten minutes.</p>
