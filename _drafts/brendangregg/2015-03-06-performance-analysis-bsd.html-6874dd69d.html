<p>System performance analysis is an enormous topic, and it's a challenge to know what can be analyzed and how. At the last <a href="https://www.meetbsd.com/">MeetBSD CA</a>, I gave a talk titled "Performance Analysis" where I discussed five key facets of this topic: observability tools, methodologies, benchmarking, profiling, and tracing. I'd recommend this talk for anyone working in the BSD family of operating systems.</p>

<p>For the talk I created an observability tools diagram for FreeBSD:</p>

<p>I have this, and my <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html">Linux</a> ones, printed out and hung up around my desk. It helps jog the memory, especially when I'm switching between operating systems.</p>

<p>The slides for my talk are on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/meetbsd2014-performance-analysis">slideshare</a>:</p>

<p>The talk was also videoed (thanks, iXsystems), which is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvKMptfXtdo">youtube</a>:</p>

<p>Apart from the slide content, my talk included additional discussion and live demos of profiling the Netflix Open Connect Appliances (OCAs), which stream our content. I even did some cscope browsing of kernel source, to understand tracing targets.</p>

<p>FreeBSD has the most advanced performance analysis toolset, which includes pmcstat(8) for CPU performance monitoring counter (PMC) analysis, and DTrace for static and dynamic tracing. On Linux I can get the same jobs done, but it sometimes feels like I can't get out of second gear. On FreeBSD, I can fly.</p>

<p>For pmcstat(8), I came up with a neat diagram for the PMC groups:</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. I do want to improve it next time I use it, and try to highlight frontend vs backend stall cycles, since that can be a useful approach for CPU analysis.</p>

<p>This is also an example of how more developed performance analysis is on FreeBSD: I tried to create this diagram for Linux perf_events for my SCALE 13x talk, but it was lacking so many PMC groups that I didn't use it. Linux can get the job done, but more often you'll need to use the raw PMC counter specifications from the Intel manual. Stuck in second gear again.</p>

<p>Just before the talk I published a collection of DTrace scripts (<a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/DTrace-tools">DTrace-tools</a>) which I wrote for the Netflix OCAs, and are installed by default. I'll find a better home for these (FreeBSD wiki or source).</p>

<p>In the talk I said I should have written a script beforehand for measuring storage I/O size, without using the DTrace io provider, as there is a bug in its translator (involving struct types). Here's one way, by instrumenting GEOM using dynamic tracing:</p>

<pre>
# <b>dtrace -n 'fbt::g_disk_start:entry { @ = quantize(args[0]-&gt;bio_length); }'</b>
dtrace: description 'fbt::g_disk_start:entry ' matched 1 probe

<p>This histogram shows that most of the I/O fell into the 1-2 Mbyte bucket, which explains the 1 millisecond minimum latency from my demo. These Netflix OCAs are tuned for streaming workloads.</p>

<p>I enjoyed meeting others in the BSD community at MeetBSD CA, and watching the talks. I was a little surprised at how welcoming, happy, and <em>relaxed</em> the BSD community is. I've been to Linux events recently (SCALE is an exception) where the mood felt a bit tense: hallway conversations were about Linus's attitude, and whether that's ok, and how much people hate or love systemd. Things are currently much more relaxed in BSD land!</p>

<p>I hope you like my talk. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb87fdKUIo8TijlK7TuBeRMgylGaN9Ec9">playlist</a> for other MeetBSD CA talks. The day after this talk, I gave another on FreeBSD flame graphs, which I'll describe in a follow up post.</p>
