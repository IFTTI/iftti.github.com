<p>Last month I gave an updated Linux Performance Tools talk for <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/archive/2014/linuxcon-europe">LinuxCon Europe 2014</a> in Düsseldorf. This included static performance tuning, as well as other updates. My performance observability tools diagram now includes rdmsr, after my post on <a href="/blog/2014-09-15/the-msrs-of-ec2.html">The MSRs of EC2</a>, where I discovered that MSRs could be useful:</p>

<p>I keep this diagram updated on <a href="/linuxperf.html">linuxperf</a>. The slides from my talk are on (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/linux-performance-tools-2014">slideshare</a>):</p>

<p>As I didn't see an official video camera in the room, I had my friends at <a href="http://www.efficios.com/">EfficOS</a> film it, who also filmed the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/622033/rss">Tracing Summit</a>. This is on (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN7Z0eCn0VY">youtube</a>):</p>

<p>The main objective of my talk was to give you exposure to what exists in the field of Linux performance tools – to turn unknown unknowns into known unknowns. </p>

<p>In my earlier <a href="/blog/2014-08-23/linux-perf-tools-linuxcon-na-2014.html">LinuxCon North America</a> talk, I had three main collections of performance tools, with a diagram for each: for observability, benchmarking, and tuning tools. For this LinuxCon Europe talk, I introduced a fourth main category: static performance tuning tools.</p>

<p>I learned about static performance tuning from a paper by Richard Elling in 2000: the idea is to check the static configured state of the system, <em>without load</em>, to look for a class of issues not found by other tools. This includes things like checking how full the filesystems are, the routing table, and network interface auto-negotiation. I feel the addition of this group of tools makes this talk complete: I'm summarizing all the main tools in one short talk.</p>

<p>At LinuxCon Europe I also saw a great talk by Ben Maurer on <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/lpc.pdf">Scaling Userspace @ Facebook</a> (slides), where he discussed some serious systems performance analysis on Linux that they have been doing. It's impressive, interesting, and deep work. Sadly I didn't see a video camera to capture it.</p>

<p>Steven Rostedt from Red Hat gave a stunning talk on <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/ocw//system/presentations/1773/original/ftrace-kernel-hooks-2014.pdf">Ftrace Kernel Hooks: More than just tracing</a> (slides). This might be the most technical talk I've ever seen! I found it particularly interesting as I've been doing a lot with ftrace, an undiscovered gem of Linux, including using it for my <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools">perf-tools</a> collection. I heard this talk was videoed, although I haven't seen the video yet.</p>

<p>I also saw Rikki Endsley, also now at Red Hat, give a talk on <a href="http://lccoelce14.sched.org/event/e883537a4136e09a421beb97440ee59b?iframe=no&amp;w=&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no#.VHD-NmTF9o8">Confessions of a Reluctant Tweeter: Social Media for Open Source Communities</a>. Rikki has contributed much to our industry, and it's interesting to hear her expertise on open source marketing in general. I had spoken about marketing earlier in the week at the Tracing Summit, where Linux technologies like ftrace could really benefit from more exposure.</p>

<p>Thanks to those who attended my talk, and the Linux Foundation for organizing another great event!</p>
