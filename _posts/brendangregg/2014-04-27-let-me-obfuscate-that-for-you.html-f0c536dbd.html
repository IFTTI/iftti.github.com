<p>In my previous post, I had assembled the following C loop, using <tt>gcc -O0</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    for (i = 0; i 

<p>It became this assembly:</p>

<pre>
[...]
    15  .L3:
    16      addl    $1, -4(%rbp)
    17  .L2:
    18      cmpl    $9999999, -4(%rbp)
    19      jle .L3
[...]
</pre>

<p>You might wonder why exactly the "<tt>&lt; 10000000</tt>" test became a <tt>jle</tt> (jump less-than or equal) of 999999, instead of a <tt>jl</tt> (jump less-than) of 1000000, like the C code. I've always suspected it's a compiler optimization to save bytes based on different binary encodings.</p>

<p>Seems that it is (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19572899/why-use-jle-instead-of-jl">stackoverflow</a>): it's about reducing the constant by 1 so that it can fit in fewer bytes. That's great, since such optimizations can improve the efficiency of the CPU caches, the cache hit ratio, and performance in general.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity I compiled both versions and ran objdump on the binaries, to see how many bytes were saved:</p>

<pre>
$ diff objdump.jl objdump.jle
124,125c124,125

&gt;   4004c1: 81 7d fc 3f 42 0f 00    cmpl   $0xf423f,-0x4(%rbp)
&gt;   4004c8: 7e f3                   jle    4004bd <main>
</main></pre>

<p><b>None</b>. But the compiler did it anyway, obfuscating the binary output. I was happier when I didn't know this.</p>

<p>What's annoying is that this makes debugging harder that it needs to be. Constants can be a good target to search for when browsing long assembly listings. Had I searched for 1000000, I wouldn't have found it.</p>

<p>The compiler does know whether the optimization makes a difference or not â€“ after all, <em>it's</em> the one emitting the final machine code!</p>

<p>This gcc version is:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>gcc --version</b>
gcc (GCC) 4.8.2 20131212 (Red Hat 4.8.2-7)
</pre>

<p>It does provide <tt>-Og</tt>. From the man page "-Og enables optimizations that do not interfere with debugging.", however, this still changes the constant.</p>

<p>I believe the code responsible in gcc is the simplify_compare_const() function from combine.c:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="sr">/* Do some canonicalizations based on the comparison code.  We prefer</span>
<span class="sr">     comparisons against zero and then prefer equality comparisons.</span>
<span class="sr">     If we can reduce the size of a constant, we will do that too.  */</span>
  <span class="n">switch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="ss">LT</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="sr">/* &lt; C is equivalent to &lt;= (C - 1) */</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">const_op</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="n">const_op</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
          <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">LE</span><span class="p">;</span>
          <span class="sr">/* ... fall through to LE case below.  */</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="k">else</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This can work; here's the optimization saving 3 bytes when the constant is 128:</p>

<pre>
jl of 128:
  4004c1:   81 7d fc 80 00 00 00    cmpl   $0x80,-0x4(%rbp)
  4004c8:   7c f3                   jl     4004bd <main>

jle of 127:
  4004c1:   83 7d fc 7f             cmpl   $0x7f,-0x4(%rbp)
  4004c5:   7e f6                   jle    4004bd <main>
</main></main></pre>

<p>Neat.</p>

<p>That makes me a bit happier about the obfuscation, knowing that some of the time this helps.</p>
