<p>"I just want to know how many times this is called."... This is a question I'm often asking for kernel, device, and application events, and there is an efficient way to answer them: using Linux <tt>perf</tt> <tt>stat</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>perf</tt> tool (aka perf_events) has different modes of operation. My previous examples on <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-06-22/perf-cpu-sample.html">CPU sampling</a>, <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-06-29/perf-static-tracepoints.html">static tracepoints</a>, and <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-07-01/perf-heat-maps.html">heat maps</a>, used a mode perf_events calls "sampling", where a binary perf.data file is written containing event data. Another mode, "counting", summarizes events in-kernel and passes the summary to user space. This is more efficient, costing less overhead in terms of CPU and storage.</p>

<h3>Process Counts</h3>

<p>How many processes are being created and destroyed? Using <tt>perf</tt> <tt>stat</tt> to <i>count</i> the sched_process tracepoints for 5 seconds:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf stat -e 'sched:sched_process_*' -a sleep 5</b>

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                20      sched:sched_process_free                     [100.00%]
                21      sched:sched_process_exit                     [100.00%]
                37      sched:sched_process_wait                     [100.00%]
                20      sched:sched_process_fork                     [100.00%]
                41      sched:sched_process_exec                     [100.00%]
                 0      sched:sched_process_hang                     

       5.001391328 seconds time elapsed
</pre>

<p>Neat. So there were 20 fork()s and 21 exit()s during 5 seconds. I used -a to match on all CPUs, and <tt>sleep 5</tt> as a dummy command to set the counting duration. You can use <tt>-p PID</tt> instead, to match a process, and skip the sleep command so that <tt>perf</tt> runs until Ctrl-C.</p>

<p>This works for any event (see <tt>perf</tt> <tt>list</tt>) including all static and dynamic tracepoints.</p>

<h3>Syscall Counts</h3>

<p>Here's syscalls:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf stat -e 'syscalls:sys_enter_*' -a sleep 5 | awk '$1'</b>
# started on Wed Jul  2 23:39:50 2014
 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
                60      syscalls:sys_enter_socket                    [99.95%]
                68      syscalls:sys_enter_connect                    [99.95%]
               148      syscalls:sys_enter_epoll_wait                    [99.97%]
                 8      syscalls:sys_enter_statfs                    [99.97%]
                18      syscalls:sys_enter_dup2                      [99.98%]
                18      syscalls:sys_enter_getcwd                    [99.98%]
               155      syscalls:sys_enter_select                    [99.98%]
               226      syscalls:sys_enter_poll                      [99.98%]
[...]
</pre>

<p>I used awk to strip out syscalls that had zero counts. If that doesn't work for you, add "-o /dev/stdout" to the <tt>perf</tt> command, which can be needed for older versions (eg, Linux 3.2). Another issue I've had with older versions is the need to increase the file descriptor limit (ulimit -n), when matching this many probes.</p>

<p>This one-liner can be a quick way to determine which syscalls are in use, before moving to using <tt>perf</tt> <tt>record</tt> for a closer look, eg, with arguments and stack traces.</p>

<h3>Interval Summary</h3>

<p><tt>perf</tt> <tt>stat</tt> can also print an interval summary in more recent versions, using <tt>-I</tt> and a duration in milliseconds. For example, showing the per-second rate of context switches:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf stat -I 1000 -e sched:sched_switch -a sleep 5</b>
#           time             counts unit events
     1.000205453                314      sched:sched_switch       
     2.000456051                290      sched:sched_switch       
     3.000644420                322      sched:sched_switch       
     4.000836009                305      sched:sched_switch       
     5.001022382                198      sched:sched_switch       
     5.001442140                  7      sched:sched_switch 
</pre>

<p>Nice. Again, this works for any event.</p>

<h3>By CPU-ID</h3>

<p>You can also decompose by CPU id:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf stat -A -e sched:sched_switch -a sleep 5</b>

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   495      sched:sched_switch                                          
CPU1                   632      sched:sched_switch                                          

       5.001377216 seconds time elapsed
</pre>

<h3>Filtering</h3>

<p>Finally, --filter can be added to only increment the counter based on a boolean test. For example, counting read() syscalls where the requested size is greater than 4 Kbytes:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf stat -e syscalls:sys_enter_read --filter 'count &gt; 4096' -a sleep 5</b>

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                 1      syscalls:sys_enter_read                                     

       5.001407932 seconds time elapsed
</pre>

<p>Notice that I used a "count" variable. Where did that come from, and what else is there?</p>

<p>You can figure out many of the variables by reading the static tracepoint definitions in the kernel source (see the example in my <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-06-29/perf-static-tracepoints.html">static tracepoints</a> post). Another way is to print their format files:</p>

<pre>
# <b>cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_read/format</b>
name: sys_enter_read
ID: 509
format:
    field:unsigned short common_type;   offset:0;   size:2; signed:0;
    field:unsigned char common_flags;   offset:2;   size:1; signed:0;
    field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;   offset:3;   size:1; signed:0;
    field:int common_pid;   offset:4;   size:4; signed:1;

    field:int nr;   offset:8;   size:4; signed:1;
    field:unsigned int fd;  offset:16;  size:8; signed:0;
    field:char * buf;   offset:24;  size:8; signed:0;
    field:size_t count; offset:32;  size:8; signed:0;

print fmt: "fd: 0x%08lx, buf: 0x%08lx, count: 0x%08lx", ((unsigned long)(REC-&gt;fd)), ((unsigned long)(REC-&gt;buf)), ((unsigned long)(REC-&gt;count))
</pre>

<p>If it's a dynamic tracepoint, you can use <tt>perf</tt> <tt>probe</tt> <tt>-V</tt> to list available variables. I wish there was a similar option for static tracepoints, as well.</p>

<p>So that's a quick tour of basic perf_events counting capabilities. More is possible; see my <a href="/perf.html">perf_events</a> page and the <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf_events wiki</a>.</p>
