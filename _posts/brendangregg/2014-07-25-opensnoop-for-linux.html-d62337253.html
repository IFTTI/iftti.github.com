<p>Here's another tool I didn't think would be possible: what files are being opened on my Linux system?</p>

<pre>
# <b>./opensnoop</b>
Tracing open()s. Ctrl-C to end.
COMM             PID      FD FILE
[...]
sshd             6503     -1 /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048
sshd             6503     -1 /etc/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048
sshd             6503    0x4 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
sshd             6503     -1 /var/run/nologin
sshd             6503     -1 /etc/nologin
sshd             6503    0x4 /etc/passwd
sshd             6503    0x4 /etc/shadow
sshd             6503    0x4 /etc/localtime
sshd             6503    0x4 /etc/security/capability.conf
sshd             6503    0x4 /etc/login.defs
[...]
</pre>

<p>This is tracing all processes system-wide, and using a more efficient tracer than <a href="/blog/2014-05-11/strace-wow-much-syscall.html">strace</a>.</p>

<p>How about just files containing "conf", to see what config files are actively opened?</p>

<pre>
# <b>./opensnoop conf</b>
Tracing open()s for filenames containing "conf". Ctrl-C to end.
COMM             PID      FD FILE
run              19107   0x3 /etc/nsswitch.conf
stat             19111   0x3 /etc/nsswitch.conf
webapp           19119   0x4 /home/webapp/3.7/rel/conf/logging.conf
webapp           19119   0x7 /etc/nsswitch.conf
webapp           19119   0x7 /etc/host.conf
webapp           19119   0x7 /etc/resolv.conf
webapp           19119   0x8 /home/webapp/3.7/rel/conf/application.properties
catalina.sh      19107   0x3 /etc/nsswitch.conf
run              19122   0x3 /etc/nsswitch.conf
[...]
</pre>

<p>Nice! So that's where my webapp config files are...</p>

<p>How about files ending in "log"?</p>

<pre>
# <b>./opensnoop 'log$'</b>
Tracing open()s for filenames containing "log$". Ctrl-C to end.
COMM             PID      FD FILE
webapp           21144   0x4 /var/tmp/webapp/3.7/stash/webapp.log
webapp           21159   0x4 /var/tmp/webapp/3.7/stash/webapp.log
webapp           21174   0x4 /var/tmp/webapp/3.7/stash/webapp.log
bash             21301   0x4 /var/log/lastlog
[...]
</pre>

<p>Oh, no wonder I couldn't find them, I wasn't looking in /var/tmp!...</p>

<p>And open()s that returned an error (eg, file not found)?</p>

<pre>
# <b>./opensnoop -x</b>
Tracing open()s. Ctrl-C to end.
COMM             PID      FD FILE
smtp             2690     -1 /usr/lib/tls/x86_64/libnss_db.so.2
smtp             2690     -1 /usr/lib/tls/libnss_db.so.2
smtp             2690     -1 /usr/lib/x86_64/libnss_db.so.2
smtp             2690     -1 /usr/lib/libnss_db.so.2
java             4680     -1 /home/tomcat/conf/Standalone/localhost
java             4680     -1 /home/tomcat/conf/Standalone/localhost
java             4680     -1 /home/tomcat/conf/Standalone/localhost
[...]
</pre>

<p>Catching a process hunt around its library path is normal, like we see here for smtp. But I wonder if that java app was supposed to be finding that file...</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools/blob/master/opensnoop">opensnoop</a> options are summarized by the USAGE message (there's also a <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools/blob/master/man/man8/opensnoop.8">man page</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools/blob/master/examples/opensnoop_example.txt">examples file</a>):</p>

<pre>
# <b>./opensnoop -h</b>
USAGE: opensnoop [-htx] [-d secs] [-p PID] [-n name] [filename]
                 -d seconds      # trace duration, and use buffers
                 -n name         # process name to match on I/O issue
                 -p PID          # PID to match on I/O issue
                 -t              # include time (seconds)
                 -x              # only show failed opens
                 -h              # this usage message
                 filename        # match filename (partials, REs, ok)
  eg,
       opensnoop                 # watch open()s live (unbuffered)
       opensnoop -d 1            # trace 1 sec (buffered)
       opensnoop -p 181          # trace I/O issued by PID 181 only
       opensnoop conf            # trace filenames containing "conf"
       opensnoop 'log$'          # filenames ending in "log"
</pre>

<p>The -p option employs an in-kernel filter for efficiency.</p>

<p>opensnoop traces events as they happen, which for very frequent open()s can begin to cost measurable overhead. The "-d" mode buffers and prints the buffer at the end, reducing overheads if needed.</p>

<h2>What, Why, and How</h2>

<p>This is another ftrace-based hack for my <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools">perf-tools</a> collection.</p>

<p>There are some great ways to implement opensnoop on Linux using tracers such as perf_events (the "perf" command) with kernel debuginfo, or using SystemTap or ktap. But my aim is to use this now on a fleet of AWS EC2 cloud instances running Linux 3.2, and <em>without</em> kernel debuginfo (which is impractical to install everywhere in this dynamic environment, since it can be 100s of Mbytes).</p>

<p>The without-debuginfo requirement makes this especially tricky. One problem was that I didn't think ftrace (or perf_events) were able to dereference strings, having only seen examples with hex addresses. It turns out they do have this capability, and in fact, opensnoop can be a few one-liners:</p>

<pre>
# <b>perf probe --add 'do_sys_open filename:string'</b>
[...]
# <b>perf record --no-buffering -e probe:do_sys_open -o - -a | PAGER=cat perf script -i -</b>
 multilog 19075 [001] 5586.323974: probe:do_sys_open: (ffffffff811af8b0) filename_string="."
 multilog 19075 [001] 5586.324013: probe:do_sys_open: (ffffffff811af8b0) filename_string="./main"
 multilog 19075 [001] 5586.324028: probe:do_sys_open: (ffffffff811af8b0) filename_string="lock"
    snmpd  1255 [000] 5586.576142: probe:do_sys_open: (ffffffff811af8b0) filename_string="/proc/net/dev"
    snmpd  1255 [000] 5586.576278: probe:do_sys_open: (ffffffff811af8b0) filename_string="/proc/net/if_inet6"
[...]
# <b>perf probe --del do_sys_open</b>
</pre>

<p>That's an example of dynamic tracing of the kernel function do_sys_open(), and examining an argument (filename) as a string. Except this needs kernel debuginfo to recognize the "filename" symbol.</p>

<p>Note that on older systems (including Linux 3.2), instead of --no-buffering it is -D.</p>

<p>Without kernel debuginfo, I can fashion a similar one-liner using CPU registers instead of symbols. I was struggling to get strings to work with this, and started thinking it wouldn't be possible, then asked for help on the <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.perf.user/1663/focus=1668">perf-users mailing list</a>. Fortunately, it is possible!</p>

<p>Instead of using registers on the entry of do_sys_open(), I ended up tracing the return value of getname() (which do_sys_open() calls), and processing that as either a char * or struct filename * depending on the kernel version. It's a brittle hack, but I thought this was a bit better than guessing the register for do_sys_open() on different platforms.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Tracing open()s can tell you a lot about running applications: the locations of their config, log, and data files, and file open errors. This is a Linux port of my popular opensnoop tool, which I've used for many years to help with performance analysis and troubleshooting.</p>

<p>This is also another proof of concept for older Linux kernels, like <a href="/blog/2014-07-16/iosnoop-for-linux.html">iosnoop</a>, using the existing ftrace and kprobes tracing frameworks. If you happen to have kernel debuginfo, you can also just use the one-liners I included above. Warnings apply: opensnoop and those one-liners use dynamic tracing on Linux, which has had kernel panic bugs in the past, so know what you are doing, test first, and use at your own risk. </p>
