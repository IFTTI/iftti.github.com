<p>Odd patterns of I/O latency can be hidden by line graphs and summary statistics, and revealed by histograms and heat maps. In my previous post I showed my Linux <a href="/blog/2014-07-16/iosnoop-for-linux.html">iosnoop</a> tool, which can trace block device I/O along with timestamps and latency. This information can be visualized, revealing any odd patterns.</p>

<p>As an example, I'll make a latency heat map from iosnoop output using my <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/HeatMap">trace2heatmap.pl</a> program (which is also on <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/HeatMap">github</a>). Here's the command I used, which captures both start (-s) and end (-t) timestamps:</p>

<pre>
# <b>./iosnoop -ts 90 &gt; out.iosnoop</b>
# <b>more out.iosnoop</b>
Tracing block I/O for 90 seconds (buffered)...
STARTs         ENDs           COMM       PID   TYPE DEV      BLOCK      BYTES   LATms
6743904.592147 6743904.592316 java      9823   R    202,32   17266904   8192     0.17
6743904.594729 6743904.594907 java      9823   R    202,16   23030152   8192     0.18
6743904.597172 6743904.597402 java      9823   R    202,32   1405848    8192     0.23
6743904.598571 6743904.598745 java      9823   R    202,32   25259784   8192     0.17
[...]
</pre>

<p>I won't use the start timestamp (STARTs), but having it at high resolution may be useful for later study.</p>

<p>Now converting this into a heatmap:</p>

<pre>
# <b>git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/HeatMap</b>
# <b>cd HeatMap</b>
# <b>cat ../out.iosnoop | awk '$1 ~ /^[0-9]/ { print $2, $9 }' | ./trace2heatmap.pl \
    --unitslatency=ms --unitstime=s --maxcol=90 --maxlat=100 --grid \
    --title="Block I/O Latency Heat Map" &gt; biolatencyheatmap.svg</b>
</pre>

<p>You can tune the various options as desired. I truncated it to 100 milliseconds (--maxlat), and added a title. This makes the following (mouse-over for details, or try the direct <a href="/blog/images/2014/biolatencyheatmap.svg">SVG</a>):</p>

<p>Great! I use these to examine latency outliers, as well as the distribution for the bulk of the I/O. Time is on the x-axis, and I/O latency on the y-axis. The number of I/O at each time and latency range is shown by the darkness of each block: darker for more.</p>

<p>In this case the bulk of the I/O is very fast, between 0 and 2 milliseconds (shown as the dark red line at the bottom). There are also clouds of high latency I/O, about every 9 seconds, which are around 70 milliseconds, creating a multimodal distrubition. Their presence would be difficult to see from average latency alone.</p>

<p>It turns out that these are due to a single disk in particular, which I can filter using awk:</p>

<pre>
# <b>cat ../out.iosnoop | awk '$6 == "202,1" { print $2, $9 }' | ...</b>
</pre>

<p>I also reduced the queue size to this slow disk using:</p>

<pre>
# <b>echo 4 &gt; /sys/block/xvda1/queue/nr_requests</b>
</pre>

<p>This type of tuning was suggested in my previous blog's comments, as a possible relief for I/O latency outliers caused by reads queueing behind a large batch of writes. This reduced the severity of the I/O latency outliers a little, and the I/O clouds a lot. (This tuning will also hurt performance for that one disk, so don't copy it without understanding what it does.)</p>

<p>See the <a href="/blog/images/2014/biolatencyheatmap_slowdisk_before.svg">before (128 queue length)</a> and <a href="/blog/images/2014/biolatencyheatmap_slowdisk_after.svg">after (4 queue length)</a> latency heat maps for that disk.</p>

<p>Have disk I/O issues? Aren't using latency heat maps? You should! See my <a href="/heatmaps.html">heat maps</a> page for more details.</p>
