 <p>The Swift programming language continues to advance with each new Xcode 6 beta, including new features, syntax enhancements, and behavioral refinements. Xcode 6 beta 3 incorporates some important changes, a few of which we’d like to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Array has been completely redesigned to have full value semantics to match the behavior of Dictionary and String. Now a <span class="keyword">let</span> array is completely immutable, and a <span class="keyword">var</span> array is completely mutable.</li>
<li>Syntax “sugar” for Array and Dictionary has changed. Arrays are declared using <span class="keyword">[Int]</span> as short hand for <span class="keyword">Array&lt;Int&gt;</span>, instead of <span class="keyword">Int[]</span>. Similarly, Dictionary uses <span class="keyword">[Key: Value]</span> for <span class="keyword">Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;</span>.</li>
<li>The half-open range operator has been changed from <span class="keyword">..</span> to <span class="keyword">..&lt;</span> to make it more clear alongside the <span class="keyword">...</span> operator for closed ranges.</li>
</ul> <p>Xcode 6 beta is free to Registered Apple Developers and can be downloaded on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">Xcode downloads page</a>. Read all about these and other changes in the complete <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/">release notes for Xcode 6 beta 3.</a></p>
