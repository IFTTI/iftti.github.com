<p>In Xcode 6 beta 4, Swift adds support for access control. This gives you complete control over what part of the code is accessible within a single file, available across your project, or made public as API for anyone that imports your framework. The three access levels included in this release are:</p> <ul> <li>
<span class="keyword">private</span> entities are available only from within the source file where they are defined.</li> <li>
<span class="keyword">internal</span> entities are available to the entire module that includes the definition (e.g. an app or framework target).</li> <li>
<span class="keyword">public</span> entities are intended for use as API, and can be accessed by any file that imports the module, e.g. as a framework used in several of your projects.</li> </ul> <p>By default, most entities have <span class="keyword">internal</span> access. This allows application developers to largely ignore access control, and most Swift code already written will continue to work without change. Your framework code does need to be updated to define <span class="keyword">public</span> API, giving you total control of the exposed interface your framework provides.</p> <p>The <span class="keyword">private</span> access level is the most restrictive, and makes it easy to hide implementation details from other source files. By properly structuring your code, you can safely use features like extensions and top-level functions without exposing that code to the rest of your project.</p> <p>Developers building frameworks to be used across their projects need to mark their API as <span class="keyword">public</span>. While distribution and use of 3rd-party binary frameworks is not recommended (as mentioned in a previous blog post), Swift supports construction and distribution of frameworks in source form.</p> <p>In addition to allowing access specification for an entire declaration, Swift allows the <span class="keyword">get</span> of a property to be more accessible than its <span class="keyword">set</span>. Here is an example class that is part of a framework:</p> <pre><code><span class="key">public class</span> ListItem {

	<span class="comment">// Public properties.</span>
	<span class="key">public var</span> text: <span class="title">String</span>
	<span class="key">public var</span> isComplete: <span class="title">Bool</span>

	<span class="comment">// Readable throughout the module, but only writeable from within this file.</span>
	<span class="key">private(set) var</span> UUID: <span class="title">NSUUID</span>

	<span class="key">public init</span>(text: <span class="title">String</span>, completed: <span class="title">Bool</span>, UUID: <span class="title">NSUUID</span>) {
		<span class="key">self</span>.text = text
		<span class="key">self</span>.isComplete = completed
		<span class="key">self</span>.UUID = UUID
	}

	<span class="comment">// Usable within the framework target, but not by other targets.</span>
	<span class="key">func</span> refreshIdentity() {
		<span class="key">self</span>.UUID = NSUUID()
	}

	<span class="key">public override func</span> isEqual(object: <span class="title">AnyObject</span>?) -&gt; <span class="title">Bool</span> {
		<span class="key">if let</span> item = object <span class="key">as</span>? <span class="title">ListItem</span> {
			<span class="key">return self</span>.UUID == item.UUID
		}
		<span class="key">return false</span>
	}
}</code></pre> <p>When mixing Objective-C and Swift, because the generated header for a framework is part of the frameworkâ€™s public Objective-C interface, only declarations marked <span class="keyword">public</span> appear in the generated header for a Swift framework. For applications, the generated header contains both <span class="keyword">public</span> and <span class="keyword">internal</span> declarations.</p> <p> For more information, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/">The Swift Programming Language</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/">Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C</a> books have been updated to cover access control. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/xcode_6_beta_4_o2p8fz/xcode_6_beta_4_release_notes.pdf">Read the complete Xcode 6 beta 4 release notes here</a>.</p>
