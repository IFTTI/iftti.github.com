						<p>On June 2, 2014 at WWDC, the Swift team finally showed you what we had been working on for years. That was a  big day with lots of excitement, for us and for developers around the world. Today, we’ve reached the second giant milestone:</p>
<p>Swift version 1.0 is now GM.</p>
<p>You can now submit your apps that use Swift to the App Store. Whether your app uses Swift for a small feature or a complete application, now is the time to share your app with the world. It’s your turn to excite everyone with your new creations.</p>
<h3>Swift for OS X</h3>
<p>Today is the GM date for Swift on iOS. We have one more GM date to go for Mac. Swift for OS X currently requires the SDK for OS X Yosemite, and when Yosemite ships later this fall, Swift will also be GM on the Mac. In the meantime, you can keep developing your Mac apps with Swift by downloading the beta of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">Xcode 6.1</a>.</p>
<h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
<p>You’ll notice we’re using the word “GM”, not “final”. That’s because Swift will continue to advance with new features, improved performance, and refined syntax. In fact, you can expect a few improvements to come in Xcode 6.1 in time for the Yosemite launch. Because your apps today embed a version of the Swift GM runtime, they will continue to run well into the future.</p>
